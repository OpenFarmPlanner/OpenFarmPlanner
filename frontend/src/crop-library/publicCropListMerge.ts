 * Keeps locally saved crops from being rolled back by a list response that

 * The page already discards list requests that were in flight when a save
 * landed, but a request started *after* the save — the search box refreshes on
 * a debounce — still carries pre-save data and would otherwise write the old
 * values straight back over the saved ones.
 *
 * An entry is dropped from `saved` as soon as the server returns that crop
 * at the saved version or newer, so an override never outlives the request it
 * was protecting against and later server-side edits still win.

/**
 * Keeps a just-created discussion topic in the list even when the reload that

 *
 * Creating a topic selects it by navigating to `?discussionId=<id>`, and a
 * guard effect deselects any discussion id that is missing from `topics` (so a
 * stale link to a deleted discussion cannot leave the page pointing at
 * nothing). If the reload response lags behind the create — ordering,
 * pagination, or a replica that has not caught up — that guard throws the user
 * straight back out of the discussion they just created. The detail pane reads
 * its title from the list entry too, so the same gap renders an endless
 * spinner instead of the new discussion.
 *
 * The created topic is prepended rather than appended: the list is ordered by
 * newest activity first, which a brand-new topic always is.
