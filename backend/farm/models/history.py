    A single user action can cascade into many entity mutations — deleting a

    revisions together so the version history shows them as one entry with a
    single "undo" that reverts the whole action.

    Deliberately generic: only `operation_type` and `context` vary, so future
    cascades (applying a season pattern, crop-rotation batch edits) reuse this
    without a schema change. `context` carries whatever the frontend needs to
    phrase the summary (e.g. `{"season_label": "25/26"}`).

    with entity size instead of project size. Point-in-time project restore is
    reconstructed by taking, for every (entity_type, object_id), the latest
