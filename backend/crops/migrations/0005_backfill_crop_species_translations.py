"""Backfill species translations from the existing single-language names.

Migration assumptions, deliberately conservative — no machine translation is
invented and no existing text is changed:

1. Every ``CropSpecies.name`` currently in the database was entered through a
   German-only UI (the app shipped German-only until this change) and is
   therefore stored as the ``de`` translation. ``name`` itself is left
   untouched and keeps serving as the canonical reference label.
2. English names are written **only** for species whose normalized name
   matches a curated entry in ``crops/seed_data.py``. Those pairs are
   hand-maintained repository data, not generated text.
3. Species that do not match a seed entry (user proposals) get a ``de`` row
   only. They will simply fall back to German in an English UI, and the
   frontend marks that as "translation missing" rather than pretending the
   German name is English.

Re-running is safe: rows are matched on (species, language_code) and existing
translations are never overwritten. The reverse operation only deletes
translation rows, so no source data can be lost.
