# Makes Playwright's Chrome channel usable on a CI runner.
#
# Shared by .github/workflows/e2e.yml and frontend-build.yml, which both need
# the browser before `npm run build` (the frontend's `postbuild` script,
# build/prerender.ts, launches Chrome itself). The Playwright config pins
# `channel: 'chrome'`, i.e. the real Google Chrome install, not the bundled
# Chromium — the screenshot baselines were recorded against it.
#
# The fast path is to install nothing. The GitHub runner image already ships
# Google Chrome, which is exactly what `channel: 'chrome'` resolves to, so if
# it launches there is nothing to do. That matters because every install route
# goes through apt, and apt on these runners is the single least reliable
# thing in CI: the mirror the image pins (azure.archive.ubuntu.com) regularly
# stops answering, apt then hangs for minutes, and when the surrounding
# `timeout` kills it the apt-get it spawned as root survives as an orphan
# holding /var/lib/apt/lists/lock until the job dies — taking every retry with
# it. Note that `npx playwright install chrome` does this too even without
# `--with-deps`: installing the Chrome channel *is* an apt install of the
# google-chrome deb.
#
# Only when no working Chrome is present do we go near apt, and then with the
# guards below: a drop-in config so apt gives up on a dead mirror instead of
# hanging, a SIGKILL of whatever still holds the lock before each retry (the
# wedged orphan is blocked on network I/O and never frees it on its own), and
# a dpkg repair so the next attempt starts clean.
#
# The caller's step timeout must exceed this script's worst case
# (max_attempts * (lock_wait + attempt_timeout) + backoff + fallback).
